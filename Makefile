# VERSION defines the project version for the bundle.
# Update this value when you upgrade the version of your project.
# To re-generate a bundle for another specific version without changing the standard setup, you can:
# - use the VERSION as arg of the bundle target (e.g make bundle VERSION=0.0.2)
# - use environment variables to overwrite this value (e.g export VERSION=0.0.2)
VERSION ?= 0.0.2

##@ General

# The help target prints out all targets with their descriptions organized
# beneath their categories. The categories are represented by '##@' and the
# target descriptions by '##'. The awk commands is responsible for reading the
# entire set of makefiles included in this invocation, looking for lines of the
# file as xyz: ## something, and then pretty-format the target and help. Then,
# if there's a line with ##@ something, that gets pretty-printed as a category.
# More info on the usage of ANSI control characters for terminal formatting:
