# Git Delta Action

This GitHub Action helps you visualize and manage file changes (deltas) across different environments, branches, or commits. It uses the `delta` tool to show diffs for specific files and folders, providing insights either offline or by querying GitHub via its REST API.

## Features

- Compare file changes (delta) between different Git branches, commits, or environments.
- Specify file patterns to include or exclude from the comparison.
- Run the delta check either offline or by querying the GitHub API.

## Inputs

| Name              | Description                                                                                              | Required | Default      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------------|
| `github_token`    | GitHub token for querying the GitHub REST API (used when comparing against environments).                 | No       | N/A          |
| `environment`     | The environment to compare against (requires GitHub token if used).                                       | No       | N/A          |
| `branch`          | The base branch to compare against.                                                                      | No       | `main`       |
| `commit`          | Specific commit to compare against.                                                                      | No       | N/A          |
| `includes`        | [Shell Glob style](https://teaching.idallen.com/cst8207/18w/notes/190_glob_patterns.html) patterns to include in the delta calculation, separated by newlines (`\n`).                        | No       | `""`         |
| `excludes`        | [Shell Glob style](https://teaching.idallen.com/cst8207/18w/notes/190_glob_patterns.html) patterns to exclude from the delta calculation, separated by newlines (`\n`). Excludes are applied after includes. | No       | `""`         |
| `online`          | Whether to run the delta comparison online using the GitHub API (`true`) or offline (`false`).            | No       | `true`       |

### Example of `includes` and `excludes`

```
includes: |
  live/local/*
  live/stag/ec2/terragrunt.hcl

excludes: |
  *.zip
  */**/README.md
```

## Outputs

| Name            | Description                                                             |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `delta_files`   | A JSON string with the paths of the files that have a delta (difference).|
| `is_detected`   | A boolean value indicating whether a delta was detected or not.          |

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use this action in your workflow:

```yaml
name: Check Git Delta

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  git-delta:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run Git Delta
        uses: jerry153fish/git-delta-action@v0.0.2
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          branch: 'main'
          includes: |
            live/prod/*
            live/stag/*
            modules/*
          excludes: |
            **/*.md
```

In this example, the Git Delta action compares the current branch against the `main` branch, considering only files in `live/prod//` and `live/prod//` while excluding markdown files (`*.md`).
